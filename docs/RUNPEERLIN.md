# Running a Peer Node on Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS)

These instructions summarize the minimum number of steps to run a [peer node](https://symbol.github.io/concepts/node.html#id1) and connect it to an existing network using the catapult-client build.

## Prerequisites

* Have built catapult-client following either [Conan](BUILD-conan.md) or [manual](BUILD-manual.md) instructions.
* Have defined the network nemesis block. Follow [these instructions](RUNNETWORKLIN.md) to run a private network.

## Replace the network configuration

> **NOTE:**
> This step is only required when connecting a peer node to a network that is up and running.
If you have not launched a network yet, move directly to ["Edit the node properties"](#edit-the-node-properties).

1. Download a copy of the following files and folders from the node that originated the network:

   * ``catapult-client/_build/resources/``
   * ``catapult-client/_build/seed/``

2. Save the downloaded files from the candidate peer node client in a new folder named ``network-config`` under the ``catapult-client/_build`` directory.

3. To add the network configuration to the peer node, run the following commands from the ``catapult-client/_build`` directory.

   ```sh
   mkdir seed
   cp -r network-config/seed/network-test/ seed/
   cp -r network-config/resources/ resources/
   ```

## Edit the node properties

The file ``resources/config-node.properties`` defines the node configuration.
Learn more about each network property in [this guide](https://symbol.github.io/guides/network/configuring-node-properties.html#properties).

Open ``resources/config-node.properties`` and search for the ``[localnode]`` section.
Then, edit the properties with the node details. You will need at least these properties:

* ``host``: IP address or domain name of your node.
* ``friendlyName``: Name of your node for display purposes.
* ``version``: Version of catapult-client used by your node. Leave empty to use the current one.
* ``roles``: A comma-separated list of the following values:
  * ``Peer``: Node verifies transactions and blocks, runs the consensus algorithm, creates new blocks ([Documentation](https://docs.symbolplatform.com/concepts/node#peer-node)).
  * ``Api``: Node provides REST access to the blockchain ([Documentation](https://docs.symbolplatform.com/concepts/node#api-node)).
  * ``Voting``: Node participates in the Finalization process ([Documentation](https://docs.symbolplatform.com/concepts/block#finalization)).
  * ``IPv4``, ``IPv6``: IP version supported by the node. If neither is specified then version 4 is assumed.

If ``host`` or ``roles`` is incorrect other nodes won't be able to connect to this one.

For example:

``` ini
[localnode]
host = <YOUR_NODE_IP>
friendlyName = myPeerNode
version = 0.10.0.4
roles = IPv4,Peer
```

## Enable harvesting

This step enables [harvesting](https://symbol.github.io/concepts/harvesting.html), which allows the node to produce new blocks.

> **NOTE:**
> At least one node of the network must have harvesting enabled to produce new blocks. If you don't want to enable harvesting, move directly to [Add other peer nodes](#add-other-peer-nodes).

1. Open the file ``resources/config-extensions-server.properties`` and enable the harvesting extension.

    ```ini
    # p2p extensions
    ...
    extension.harvesting = true
    ...
    ```

2. Edit the file ``resources/config-harvesting.properties``.

    ```ini
    [harvesting]
    harvesterSigningPrivateKey = <HARVESTER_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY>
    harvesterVrfPrivateKey = <HARVESTER_VRF_PRIVATE_KEY>
    enableAutoHarvesting = true
    ...
    ```

   * Replace ``<HARVESTER_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY>`` with the private key of an [eligible account](https://symbol.github.io/concepts/harvesting.html#eligibility-criteria).

   * Replace ``<HARVESTER_VRF_PRIVATE_KEY>`` with the private key linked to the harvester account to randomize the block production. The link could be defined in the [nemesis block](RUNNETWORKLIN.md#append-the-vrf-keys-to-the-nemesis-block) or at a later point by announcing a **VRFKeyLinkTransaction** with the [CLI](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-cli/blob/gh-pages/0.20.3.md#vrfkeylink) or [SDKs](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-sdk-typescript-javascript).

## Generate TLS certificates

Catapult uses TLS 1.3 to provide secure connections and identity assurance among all nodes.

1. To generate and self sign the TLS certificate, you can use [symbol-node-configurator](https://github.com/symbol/symbol-node-configurator).

2. Open ``resources/config-user.properties`` and make sure that ``certificateDirectory`` points to the directory where the TLS certificates are being stored.

    ```ini
    [storage]

    seedDirectory = ../seed
    dataDirectory = ../data
    certificateDirectory = ../certificate
    pluginsDirectory = .
    ...
    ```

## List known peer nodes

The file ``resources/peers-p2p.json`` should list strong nodes to serve as beacons.
A random subset of beacons should be set in each node's peer file for best network performance.

> **NOTE:**
> If you just created the network and your node is the only one, make sure to add it to this file.

1. Open ``resources/peers-p2p.json`` and replace the public key and host with the public key, host, and port of the node that originated the network.

    ```json
    {
        "_info": "this file contains a list of all trusted peers and can be shared",
        "knownPeers": [
            {
                "publicKey": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
                "endpoint": {
                "host": "127.0.0.1",
                "port": 7900
                },
                "metadata": {
                    "name": "peernode",
                    "roles": "Peer"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    To get the node public key, run the following command in the folder that contains the node's certificates:

    ```sh
    openssl pkey -pubin -in ca.pubkey.pem -noout -text | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex
    ```

2. If the network has more peer nodes, you can add them to the ``knownPeers`` array.

## Run the node

```sh
cd bin
./catapult.server
```

If this is the first node of the network, you should see in the terminal the peer node producing new blocks:

```sh
... successfully harvested block at 1804 with signer ...
```

If you are connecting to an existing network, you should see the peer node synchronizing blocks:

```sh
... peer returned 42 blocks (heights 2 - 43)
```

The node can be stopped by pressing ``Ctrl-C`` and restarted simply by running ``catapult.server`` again.

## Check that the node is accessible and running

Finally, while the node is running and producing log output, open another terminal and move into the `_build/bin` folder. Then run `catapult.tools.health` to connect to the running node and retrieve some statistics:

```sh
cd _build/bin
./catapult.tools.health
```

Among other things, you should see a line reporting the current chain height:

```sh
... peernode @ 127.0.0.1:7900 [P2P] at height 118 (78 finalized) with score ...
```

The health tool connects to all nodes listed in the ``resources/peers-p2p.json`` so make sure you have added your own node to the list.
